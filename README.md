Module 9 - Surfs Up Advanced Data challenge


## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this review is to check the weather datasets and perform a comparison between two important months for the business (June and December).  To do this, a SQLite database will be used to analyze and combine the necessary data and provide background for the business decision.  

To compare the data from SQLite we have used SQLAlchemy to generate queries of the datasets and pull it for analysis.  Jupiter Notebook is the primary tool used to run the data through Python and Pandas system.  Results for the two months are shown below.

### June

### Comparison

This Hawaii location shows a very small difference between two months that are generally considered very different.  For a Surf shop investor, this is a strong basis for possible new business.  The average temperature only varies by ~4 degrees between the months and the maximum by only ~2 degrees.

Mean - 75 to 71

Max - 85 to 83

Min - 64 to 56

### Summary

This location seems an excellent choice for possible business as the shop could function year round and still perform sales.  Future analysis can also check the other data such as:
